# Bingo

This is an in-browser client only implementation of the American 75-number version of Bingo.

The game can be played over a video conference call.

## Players Card

Players start by opening up the players card. A new card is generated automatically. The card will be regenerated on page reload or by clicking on the "New Game" button.

The Bingo caller will call numbers randomly picked. If the number appears on your card, click on that number in your card to mark the number. If you accidentally click the wrong number, clicking on a marked square will remove the mark.

Once you have completed a horizontal, vertical, 5 square diagonal, or the whole card, YELL BINGO as loud as possible. Other players can make note that a line is gone by selecting the completed line via the buttons below the card.

On page load, or after clicking the "New Game" button, the system will reset. A random number between 1 and 75 is drawn on each click of the "Draw Number" button.
